Snowflake is a multi-tenant, transactional, secure, highly scalable and elastic system with full SQL support and 
built-in extensions for semi-structured and schema-less data.  

### Architecture 
![](/img/snowflake_architecture.png "Multi Cluster, Shared Data Architecture")  
Snowflake is a service-oriented architecture composed of highly fault tolerant and independently scalable services.
These services communicate through RESTful interfaces and fall into three architectural layers:  

1. **Data Storage**   
2. **Virtual Warehouses**
3. **Cloud Services**
